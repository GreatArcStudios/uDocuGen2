The goal of uDocumentGenerator is innovate on making documentation generation for Unity as plug and play as possible while generating a modern, easy to use website that is designed to make finding fields, methods and classes as painless as possible. I came up with this idea as a result of  generating documentation for my [Open Source Pause Menu](https://forum.unity.com/threads/wip-unity-open-source-pause-menu.386495/). The documentation generator I used got the information correctly at the cost of a messy generated folder structure and a sub optimal/ugly website.  


Being version 1.0, there are some drawbacks such as not generating for more than one class per file, but those can be easily remedied as the code is encapsulated. It currently deals extremely well with a normally formatted and commented project, meaning that within minutes, you'll have a custom documentation website for your project. At the moment the only things you may want to change code wise are: the title tag in the React app, the social media links, and the logo.
