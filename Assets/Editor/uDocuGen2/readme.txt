The recommended readme is hosted at https://ezhu.build/uDocumentGenerator 

I would highly, highly recommend giving the whole website a read over. It's both the docs for the asset and the docs for the uDocumentGenerator scripts. 

The quick and dirty version is that before doing anything, clone the github repo: https://github.com/GreatArcStudios/uDocumentGenerator

After cloning the github repo, fill in the blanks that come up on the uDocumentGenerator editor extension. Click generate. The generate button will createa file called config.js. Check out your website. 

Note: saving config.js to the build folder of the React App will let you instantly see your docs.
